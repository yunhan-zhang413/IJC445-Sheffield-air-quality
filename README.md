IJC445 Data Science coursework: sheffield air quality and meteorological analysis(2023)
Question: How do daily NO₂ concentrations in Sheffield (2023) vary across monitoring sites and seasons, and how are they associated with meteorological conditions?
Data: DEFRA UK-AIR (NO₂ daily means for SHBR, SHDG, SHE) + Open-Meteo archive (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation).
Key messages: winter NO₂ is higher than summer; site-level differences are visible; NO₂ correlates negatively with wind speed (r = −0.424) and temperature (r = −0.370), and positively with relative humidity (r = 0.333).
Output: a composite visualisation combining a time series, seasonal boxplot, and scatter plots with trend lines.
